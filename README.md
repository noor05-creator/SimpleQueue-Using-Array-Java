# Simple Queue Using Array in Java

This repository contains an implementation of a **Simple Linear Queue** in Java using an array. It supports basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and printing the queue elements.

## 🚀 Features

- `pushRear(int data)` – Enqueue operation (add to the rear)
- `popFront()` – Dequeue operation (remove from the front)
- `isFull()` – Check if the queue is full
- `isEmpty()` – Check if the queue is empty
- `print()` – Print all elements from front to rear

## 💡 Learning Focus

This project is part of my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice to master core concepts of queue operations using arrays. Key learnings include:
- Front and rear pointer tracking
- Fixed-size memory queue behavior
- Resetting queue when empty

## 📂 File Structure

- `Queue` – Class implementing queue logic
- `Main` – Contains driver code for testing

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
